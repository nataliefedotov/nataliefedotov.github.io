    <p>The Swamp House contains two rooms. As you enter, there is the main room, which functions as both a kitchen and dining room and a bed for the Triplets. And the west of the main room is our bedroom. However, no furniture in the house because it is just an empty tree stump with no doors of windows carved into it. Outside, an ogre mud bath where I can relax and play with my children...what are you doing in my swamp?!</p>
